1
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,334
<i>On the night of the
15th of January 1905–</i>

2
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,417
<i>– something intruded into
people's deepest slumbers.</i>

3
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:47,167
<i>When a huge mountain landslide
in Lodalen in Nordfjord</i>

4
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:51,709
<i>caused a huge flood which
killed 63 people.</i>

5
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:58,209
<i>The floodwaters swept went through
Lovatnet 40 metres high.</i>

6
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:03,626
<i>It's 58 years since the Tafjord
catastrophe in Sunnmøre.</i>

7
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:08,917
<i>When 40 people lost their lives after a
huge boulder tumbled into the lake.</i>

8
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:18,751
<i>Research shows there are 300 unstable
mountains in Norway today.</i>

9
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:23,959
<i>Everybody knows that it's just a matter
of time before the next major landslide.</i>

10
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:30,376
<i>Geiranger fears that it will suffer
the next big catastrophe .</i>

11
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:33,584
<i>Hanging over the town of Åkerneset
on the fjord–</i>

12
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,251
<i>– A giant unstable massif
is ready to crumble.</i>

13
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:42,792
<i>Plunging 7 million cubic meters
of rock down into the fjord–</i>

14
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,959
<i>– creating an enormous tsunami.</i>

15
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:51,501
<i>The cracks are already widening. No other
place has such geological activity.</i>

16
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:56,792
<i>The question is can people be warned
before the mountain collapses into the fjord?</i>

17
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:11,167
VÅGEN - THE WAVE

18
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:16,084
What's this?
I am 40! Come on!

19
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,501
– Hello?
– Hi Dad.

20
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,334
– What is happening?
– Mum is fixing the sink.

21
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,792
Can you give me a pair of pliers?

22
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,959
Can't we call a plumber? Here.

23
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,834
I don't need a plumber, but can you
get me the plumber's wrench?

24
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:03,417
– It's in there.
– Here mum.

25
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:07,917
– How do you know what that wrench looks like?
– Everybody knows.

26
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,251
So there.

27
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,917
We won't need it when we move.

28
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:23,626
This house has soul.

29
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:30,501
– What do you mean by soul?
– Soul is the sort of nonsense that mum believes in.

30
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,251
– What did you say?
– I didn't say anything.

31
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:38,792
The apartment is brand new.
It has a beautiful view.

32
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,084
Outside the door there's the whole town.

33
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:45,126
And everything is run by remote control.

34
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:49,209
– Lamps, music, blinds...
– Pass me the broccoli.

35
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:53,667
And the thing I like most is

36
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:57,876
that you can lock and open the door
with your mobile phone.

37
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:02,917
It has a key app.

38
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:10,209
– And you believe that?
– No, I had to double-check.

39
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:15,667
I've never seen a key app
before in my life! Come on!

40
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:26,417
Idun, what do you think?
Shall we throw this away? Or...?

41
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:31,626
Toss your shirts away?
Aren't they nice?

42
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,709
New place, new start...

43
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,792
OK. You know what?

44
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:45,417
I think you have to wear a suit.
You need a suit and tie from now on.

45
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:51,126
Get a haircut. Get a nice style.
This will be great

46
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:55,917
– We don't give a shit about that, we'll stay.
– No, we have decided.

47
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,334
It'll be fine.

48
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:03,584
Maybe I can get more attention than the mountain.

49
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:06,501
Do you want attention?

50
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:10,042
– Shall I give you attention?
– Don't tickle me!

51
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,917
No! Not on the kitchen counter!

52
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:22,876
We'll cook there in the morning.

53
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:39,501
Monitoring the landslide risk of Åknes/Geiranger
102.1 metres above sea level.

54
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,959
The Sixth to the seventh.

55
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,084
Is everything normal?

56
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:16,251
It's moved 0.3 mm over the last 24 hours.
It's within the normal limit.

57
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:20,459
Hi.
What's happening in the old oil town?

58
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,334
Same as usual. Bunch of suits.

59
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:29,876
– The classic outfit of the capitalists.
– How long has it been?

60
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,417
Two days in the big city
and he's a connoisseur now.

61
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,167
Yes, that's how it goes.

62
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:44,251
"Thanks for everything"...
It sounds like you're buried.

63
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:47,709
Make the cake yourself next time then.

64
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:52,751
– I hope that will take a long time.
– It looks absolutely stunning, Margot.

65
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,001
Yes...

66
00:08:56,501 --> 00:09:02,084
Dear Kristian, remember that this is...
your last day with us.

67
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,042
<i>It sounds like a funeral...!</i>

68
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,001
Here, Jacob.

69
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:11,542
Unfortunately it's not only here
that we have mountains.

70
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,126
There are also mountains in the North Sea.

71
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:18,167
I understand the oil boys
who want someone like you.

72
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:21,876
You're talented and devoted.

73
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:26,917
I speak for everybody here when I say
you're going to be sorely missed.

74
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:30,209
– It gets boring.
– Thank you.

75
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:36,917
But it's going to be bloody nice not to
have to triple check everything we do.

76
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:42,876
– Cheers for that.
– Cheers.

77
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,251
– Is that the fifth level as well?
– It looks like that.

78
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,584
– What's happened?
– The groundwater suddenly sank.

79
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:38,126
In the fourth and fifth level.
And then we lost contact.

80
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,042
Can you show me?

81
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:49,709
– Get to camera A.
– Two seconds.

82
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:56,126
Zoom in?

83
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:02,292
– There were no other movements?
– No. Completely still.

84
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,001
– The connection can be poor.
– It appears stable.

85
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,792
We'll have a peek next time we're up there.
Can somebody turn off the bloody alarm?!

86
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:16,042
Kristian? Kristian!

87
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:22,209
The mountain is still. It is OK.
Hurry and pack. We're in control.

88
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:34,834
– Look, I've got room for everything!
– Great, honey.

89
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:40,417
– Shall I take these as well?
– Yes, you can carry out the boxes.

90
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,167
– Shouldn't he help?
– Yes, he should actually.

91
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:52,917
– Hi, how's the packing going?
– It's going well.

92
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:01,709
That frown, Kristian... I
thought it would have gone by now.

93
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:08,917
Something strange happened with
the groundwater today.

94
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:12,167
It's not your job anymore.

95
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:15,734
That rock has stood for thousands of years
and will stand securely for thousands more.

96
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:21,459
Now you have to finish packing so
we can drive away tomorrow.

97
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:26,626
Pack that frown up too.
So, let's go now!

98
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:34,251
– Can you see how mum is nagging dad?
– Everyone has to do their bit, you know, dad.

99
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:29,292
How's it going, mate?

100
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,292
I really feel comfortable here.

101
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:39,667
I know that Geiranger is not
the centre of the world...

102
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,334
But it's safe. It's home.

103
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,417
- I know that it's hard.
- It's not that.

104
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:59,084
But mum and I made the decision we
think is best for our family.

105
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:05,501
It's not always easy to be the one
making the difficult choices.

106
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,709
But what will the next thing be?

107
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:12,084
When we've lived in Stavanger
for a couple of years

108
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,792
Will it be up and out
and we'll move again?

109
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,626
This whole damn country
is made of stone.

110
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:42,584
What's happening here.
Are you going to move?

111
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,792
Come here.

112
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:51,167
– You as well.
– Me too.

113
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,084
Hi, Sondre.

114
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:57,876
We will see how long
you can stand the asphalt...

115
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:02,709
And Kristian with a tie round his neck.
That will be something completely new.

116
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:07,876
– We'll get used to it.
– It will tighten around his neck.

117
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:11,917
– Are you ready?
– Yes, just about.

118
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:16,667
The family will take the ferry today
and I'll work a couple of days more.

119
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:20,917
– So you're not going now?
– No, you're not quite rid of me yet.

120
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,959
– Dad, it's our turn.
– Are you going to go or what?

121
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,376
Wait here. I won't be long.

122
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:27,584
– I bought the apartment and stuff.
– Hi, I have to show you something.

123
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:52,126
Hotel Geiranger
1.7 meters above sea level.

124
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,209
– Hi, Vibeke.
– You're finally here.

125
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,876
I was going to help you.

126
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:09,751
Welcome to Geiranger.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

127
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:12,834
– I don't mind.
– What's your name?

128
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:17,042
– Maria and Phillip Poulsen.
– We'll see if we can find you a room.

129
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:20,251
– Has your family gone?
– They should be on the ferry soon.

130
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:27,167
What if the problem's not with the sensors
but the cables leading there.

131
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,626
Is that possible?

132
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:37,001
All mountains are made of plates.
Our mountain is no exception.

133
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:40,542
Our drill holes go through all the plates.

134
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:45,542
You said that the groundwater disappeared
just before we lost contact.

135
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,751
Groundwater can't vanish just like that.

136
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:55,334
It finds new ways, it makes new layers.
It creates friction.

137
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,126
And that displaces the layers.

138
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:04,042
If the movement was big enough
it could have cut the line.

139
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:09,376
Then we drill new holes and replace the sensors
It's no big deal.

140
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,209
No.

141
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:16,709
But if the weight of the mountain's
shift was big enough...

142
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,917
The cracks wouldn't widen before it falls.

143
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,584
And there will be no warning.

144
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:29,334
Control Station Ørnereidet
874.1 metres above sea level.

145
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,167
Gently now.

146
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:38,334
That is Geiranger's
major tourist attraction.

147
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:51,417
When you're in such a beautiful place
you want to see the fjord.

148
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:56,209
I understand that. Just tell me if you need something.
Bye for now!

149
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:04,334
Hi, Sondre. What?

150
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,001
Where are you now?

151
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,584
OK?

152
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,626
Shit!

153
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,542
Have we got contact?

154
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,876
<i>– Do you have a picture?
– Yes, we're watching you.</i>

155
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:29,876
That's good to know.

156
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:54,542
– You check level four, and I'll take number five.
– Yep.

157
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:40,501
Kristian?

158
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:11,292
– This isn't normal wear and tear.
– No, it's clear that something happened.

159
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:15,417
There's quite a lot of movement
in the mountain now. You get it?

160
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:19,751
Obviously we're going to investigate further.
We'll sort it out.

161
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,709
What do you mean?

162
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:25,084
Do more tests, drill more holes.

163
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:31,042
More holes? Are you crazy? Do I have to
remind you of what can happen?

164
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:37,251
We're talking about an 80 metre high wave here.

165
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,626
Ten minutes later there'd be no more Geiranger.

166
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:44,917
– We also know what can happen.
– It doesn't seem like it.

167
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,501
What the hell do you want me to do?

168
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,792
Should I press this and
cause complete panic?

169
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,959
And cut the tourist season short?

170
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:03,709
– Since when do you care about tourism?
– That's not what it's about.

171
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,626
What happens–

172
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:10,126
– If we cry wolf every time we think
something's happening up there?

173
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:13,876
What the hell will we do
on the day it crashes down?

174
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,459
Tell us what we should do then.

175
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:25,667
Yellow alert. The station must be full manned.
On call 24 hours up on the mountain.

176
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,709
Yes.

177
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,209
What do you think?

178
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,251
Are you just going to stand by
and watch it happen?!

179
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:41,917
Jacob?

180
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:52,501
Kristian, listen.
I understand you're upset.

181
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:57,417
I know you only want what's best but
you have to calm down a bit.

182
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:06,626
We found the severed cables but nothing
suggests we have to do anything.

183
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,834
The mountain is still, Kristian.

184
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,417
OK. Sorry.

185
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,417
I don't know what got into me.

186
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,959
I shouldn't...

187
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:45,834
We're not waiting here. Ring mum!

188
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,459
Oh, damn it, Jesus!

189
00:27:57,251 --> 00:28:02,251
Geez... You are so fucking smoked.

190
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,376
You have a visitor.

191
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:37,042
Have you gone mad?

192
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:41,167
You can't put the kids in the car
and then work for several hours.

193
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:45,876
– I know. I'm sorry.
– You don't even work there anymore.

194
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:49,292
– I fucked up.
– Yes, you did.

195
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:52,626
I've got a bad feeling that...

196
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:57,792
Yes. There'll be no Stavanger today.

197
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:03,042
– No.
– OK.

198
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:06,917
You lot get to sleep in the hotel tonight.

199
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:09,834
– Cool.
– We will? OK?

200
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,626
– Then you can try again tomorrow.
– Yes.

201
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:18,334
– But I want to sleep at home.
– It's completely empty, it won't be cosy anymore.

202
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:26,042
– I want to say goodbye to the house.
– If you want to, let's do it. Come on.

203
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:32,501
Is that OK?
– Let's go to the house.

204
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,376
– Are you coming?
– No.

205
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,417
– I'm going to sort out a hotel room for you.
– Yes, thanks.

206
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:46,417
Say goodbye from me too.
So. Good night my darling.

207
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:51,167
Bye, mate.
See you tomorrow.

208
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,417
– OK. Then we'll go and pack.
– Can I take your name please?

209
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:01,459
My name is Sondre Eikjord.

210
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:08,376
– Can I sit in the front?
– Of course you can.

211
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:22,834
OK, put your seatbelt on and tighten it.

212
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:26,792
OK, then we're ready.

213
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:32,167
– Dad.
– Yes

214
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:38,334
– Are you and mum getting a divorce now?
– No. No, we're not splitting up.

215
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:43,876
We had a little fight and then
we made friends again.

216
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,501
Everything will be fine again.

217
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:49,584
I hope so.

218
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:53,584
– That's life.
– That's life!

219
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:57,334
Here is your room.

220
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,042
So.

221
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:06,459
I hope the room meets your expectations.

222
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:14,001
– Make yourself comfortable.
– I will be.

223
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:18,959
Can I go to work? Do you know what
bottles you can't take from the minibar?

224
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:21,167
Yes, alright.

225
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:24,626
And which TV channels you can't watch?

226
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:28,584
Look after yourself.

227
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:33,292
Where are you going to sleep, dad?

228
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:44,251
I'll sleep in this.

229
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,876
I will sleep well on it.

230
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:58,626
So. Does it feel good?

231
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,626
We don't need a hotel.

232
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:08,459
– No, this has more soul.
– Yes...

233
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,751
Yes, it really has it.

234
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:58,751
Dear Kristian. Thanks for all the great years.
Good luck in Stavanger.

235
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:46,042
TSUNAMI DANGER ZONE

236
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:56,292
SHELTER

237
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,292
I acted like an idiot today.
I'm Sorry.

238
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:41,751
– These beds are bloody terrible.
– Yes.

239
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:49,542
What a shame it should finish like this.
This thing with Kristian.

240
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:54,917
Do you think he'll stay in the
oil industry a long time?

241
00:34:56,709 --> 00:35:00,042
We'll see.
He'll probably be back in a year.

242
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:08,584
When the mountains get hold of you
they never let you go.

243
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:14,584
– What the hell, Arvid?
– I read it in a book.

244
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,667
So that's what you did.

245
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:06,834
<i>The Hurtigruten cruise ship means
something special for people along the coast.</i>

246
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:10,042
<i>It's an incredibly beautiful trip.</i>

247
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,667
<i>Some call it the world's
most beautiful voyage...</i>

248
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:28,417
– Hi.
– Hi.

249
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,167
<i>Hello?</i>

250
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,459
<i>Mikal?</i>

251
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,417
Damn!

252
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,417
Shit!

253
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:13,917
– Margot?
– Yes?

254
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:44,876
<i>Arvid? – Jacob?</i>

255
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:54,084
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

256
00:38:57,751 --> 00:39:00,876
<i>– Arvid?
– Yes, over.</i>

257
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:05,084
We're getting strange data here.

258
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:08,917
It looks as if the mountain
has been pulled together.

259
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:14,584
– That can't be right.
– Several sensors show it.

260
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,876
Recalibrate the whole lot
and take another reading.

261
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,292
OK.

262
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,584
– Are you ready for an evening trip?
– Sure.

263
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,042
– We'll drive down and have a look.
– Now?

264
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,626
<i>Yes, so we can check it out.</i>

265
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,084
<i>We'll soon be down there.</i>

266
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:38,292
Hello, yes, hi, you?

267
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:44,001
Yes, wait a moment. – It's Kristian.

268
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:50,584
– Hi. Are you missing this place already?
– No, no, we're going tomorrow.

269
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,376
<i>– Is everything OK up there?
– Yes.</i>

270
00:40:56,542 --> 00:41:00,084
There are just a few sensors
behaving a bit strangely.

271
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:03,876
They show contractions in the rock.

272
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:10,876
<i>– Contractions?
– Yes, but it's probably a mistake.</i>

273
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:16,834
<i>Arvid and Jacob are down there now
checking it out so we'll soon know.</i>

274
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:24,459
– OK.
– I'll keep you updated.

275
00:41:24,626 --> 00:41:29,709
<i>– Thanks for that. We'll be in touch. See you.
– Bye.</i>

276
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:17,709
What the hell was that?

277
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:21,959
The geophone just recorded a quake here.

278
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:25,251
<i>Yes, we felt it here too.</i>

279
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,876
An additional minus 0.8 on C6.

280
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:11,792
Are you giving me data on C6?

281
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:16,126
1.72. Minus 2.6 over the last hour.

282
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:24,167
Holy shit.

283
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:28,042
Same here.
Confirming the contraction.

284
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:33,001
Shall we check out number seven as well?

285
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:39,792
Yes, I'll take it. Bloody hell.

286
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,542
Landslide.

287
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:44,334
Are Arvid and Jacob still down there?

288
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:49,459
– Yes. All the data is correct.
– Listen up. Get them up out of there at once.

289
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:52,667
– What do you mean?
– Connect me with Arvid.

290
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:59,834
– Arvid?
– Yes, over.

291
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:05,376
– Hold on a sec. There you go, Kristian.
– Arvid? Arvid, can you hear me?

292
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:07,501
<i>Hello?</i>

293
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:10,792
<i>– Kristian?
– Go to hell.</i>

294
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:15,751
<i>– Drop what you're doing and get out.
– We're just going to finish up here.</i>

295
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:20,209
I've checked the data
from Vajont and Randa.

296
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:25,084
They recorded contractions
just before the landslide.

297
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:28,126
<i>The same thing in both places.</i>

298
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:33,001
Arvid, they didn't expand,
they were drawn together.

299
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:44,417
We're coming up.

300
00:45:59,376 --> 00:46:03,501
– What was that? What's happening?
– Jacob is stuck!

301
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:07,584
– Calm down, I'll get you free.
– What's happening? Arvid?

302
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:10,251
Jacob's feet are stuck!

303
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:22,584
I'm going to get you out.
Everything will be alright.

304
00:46:22,751 --> 00:46:26,917
– What does the sensor say?
– Wait a moment.

305
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:31,251
The water table is falling
in several locations.

306
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,417
I've lost contact.

307
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:41,126
Jacob, it will sort itself out.

308
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:05,501
– Margot? Sound the alarm.
– But...

309
00:47:07,626 --> 00:47:10,001
Go to red! Go to red!

310
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,626
<i>Margot, sound the alarm!</i>

311
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:51,251
– What the hell are you doing?
– It's not strong enough for both of us.

312
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:09,709
Arvid!

313
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:13,334
Arvid!

314
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:53,667
– Hello? Margot?
– Dad, what's going on?

315
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:11,167
Hi. What happened?

316
00:50:34,001 --> 00:50:36,751
Ten... Ten minutes.

317
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:42,542
We have ten minutes.
We need to get the guests out!

318
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,626
– Find the bus driver!
– Yes!

319
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:54,834
Come on!

320
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:01,501
In. In. Seat belt on.

321
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:26,876
For God's sake, answer now!

322
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,584
<i>Welcome to Voicemail...</i>

323

Wake up! Everyone has to wake up!
Come on! Get outside!

324
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:38,001
Everybody out of the hotel!
Everybody must get out!

325
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:41,417
Everybody must get out!
Everybody out of the hotel!

326
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:46,292
– Excuse me, is this a practise drill?
– No, there's been a landslide.

327
00:51:46,459 --> 00:51:49,126
Wake up! Everyone out!

328
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,709
Everybody must wake up!

329

<i>– Thank heavens! Where are you?
– In the hotel.</i>

330
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:09,084
– I'm getting people out. Have you got Julia with you?
– Yes, we're sat in the car.

331
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,334
<i>– Good.
– Screw your stuff! Drop everything! Come on!</i>

332
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:16,584
You don't have enough time!
You have to get up the hill now!

333
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:18,292
Wake up!

334
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:21,626
Get in the backseat.

335
00:52:24,334 --> 00:52:29,376
– We're on our way. We'll pick you up now.
– No, you don't have enough time. Run to safety.

336
00:52:30,126 --> 00:52:31,792
We're driving now!

337
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:37,917
– Idun, we have enough time.
– No! Get Julia to safety.

338
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:43,042
<i>– You promise?
– What about you and Sondre?</i>

339
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:45,126
We have a bus here.

340
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:57,876
Are you on the way?

341
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:05,709
<i>– All right.
– Are you driving now?</i>

342
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:09,001
– Yes, I'll do that.
– Good.

343
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:13,584
<i>– Drive up and we'll see you soon.
– OK.</i>

344
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:16,376
We're leaving soon too. – Out, quickly!

345
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:19,292
<i>Everyone has to get out now!</i>

346
00:53:50,459 --> 00:53:53,792
– Please, listen to me!
– What about the luggage?

347
00:53:53,959 --> 00:53:55,792
To hell with it!

348
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:58,709
He doesn't want to drive the bus.

349
00:53:58,876 --> 00:54:03,376
A tsunami is on the way. We've got
minutes to get 80 metres higher.

350
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:07,334
Drive the bus now.
– Vibeke, we must get everybody out now.

351
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:11,626
Come on, everybody out, out to the bus!

352
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:14,501
Where is Sondre? Sondre?

353
00:54:17,209 --> 00:54:19,751
– Sondre!
– Hurry up!

354
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,001
No, no, no, no...

355
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:21,542
– Julia, come on.
– What are we going to do?

356
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:24,126
We're going to sprint a bit.

357
00:55:24,292 --> 00:55:29,001
– What are you doing?
– We don't have time! Get higher on the hill!

358
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:32,209
Sondre!

359
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:38,001
Sondre?

360
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:48,917
<i>– Sondre?
– – The subscriber cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

361
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:51,417
Sondre!

362
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,292
Come on!

363
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:58,501
Come on! Get out of the car!

364
00:56:01,376 --> 00:56:04,834
Up! Get up higher on the hill!

365
00:56:07,209 --> 00:56:09,667
Get up! Run!

366
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:15,251
– What's happening?
– Get up higher!

367
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,751
– Come, come, quickly.
– Into the bus.

368
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:27,417
– I have to get my cell phone.
– No, you don't have time!

369
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,959
Häråt. Come this way. Come on now!

370
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:36,709
Vibeke. Have you seen Sondre?

371
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:41,334
No. Yes, before, in the corridor.

372
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:44,626
– One missing.
– We have to drive out to make it!

373
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:47,959
– I can't leave without Sondre.
– Idun!

374
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:50,459
I can't leave without my son!

375
00:56:50,626 --> 00:56:53,792
It's her son.
I have to help her.

376
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:57,334
– What the hell is going on?
– We have to help her find her son.

377
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,209
– We have to get into the bus.
– Come now!

378
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:02,501
Holy shit!

379
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:04,834
We don't have enough time then!

380
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:29,376
Thomas, get out of the car and run.

381
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,334
Out! Run!

382
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:37,917
Come on. Run, run, run!

383
00:57:40,334 --> 00:57:41,626
Run!

384
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,626
– Anna!
– Mum!

385
00:58:07,209 --> 00:58:10,459
– Thomas, take the kids.
– Run, Thomas!

386
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:14,584
– Dad!
– Run as fast as you can!

387
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:17,042
– Dad!
– Run!

388
00:58:40,959 --> 00:58:42,834
We don't have enough time.

389
00:58:44,751 --> 00:58:46,584
Kristian, run!

390
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,501
Seat belt!

391
00:59:57,417 --> 01:00:02,001
– Sondre!
– Maria! We have to get to the bus.

392
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:07,501
Listen to me for heaven's sake!
We have to get back to the bus now.

393
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:12,792
Quiet. I can hear something.

394
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,376
Sondre?

395
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:20,667
– There's somebody down there.
– Sondre? Sondre!

396
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:25,126
– Sondre!
– What happened?

397
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:28,042
– Come on!
– What's going on?

398
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:47,667
There are shelters in the basement.
Come on!

399
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,751
Maria! Maria!

400
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,876
Come on!

401
01:01:26,709 --> 01:01:28,417
Maria!

402
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:39,334
Maria!

403
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:41,959
Hold tight!

404
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,667
Maria!

405
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:49,376
Phillip!

406
01:01:57,876 --> 01:01:59,751
Maria!

407
01:02:02,876 --> 01:02:06,209
– Close the door. Close it!
– Maria!

408
01:02:07,376 --> 01:02:10,459
– Close the door!
– She's out there!

409
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:16,001
Close the door! Or we're all going to die!

410
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:19,126
She's gone.

411
01:02:20,584 --> 01:02:22,667
She's gone.

412
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:27,709
Phillip, she's gone.
We've got to close the door.

413
01:05:18,459 --> 01:05:20,501
Julia...

414
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:41,959
<i>Hello?</i>

415
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,626
<i>Hello?</i>

416

– Jacob?
– Margot.

417
01:05:51,709 --> 01:05:55,292
Are you OK?
Is Arvid OK?

418
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:07,126
<i>Jacob, is Arvid there?
Jacob?</i>

419
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:41,626
Julia?

420
01:06:45,792 --> 01:06:47,917
Julia?

421
01:06:56,626 --> 01:06:58,376
Julia!

422
01:07:02,584 --> 01:07:04,959
– Julia!
– Dad!

423
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:07,542
– Julia?
– Dad!

424
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:11,417
Dad!

425
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:21,001
Let me have a look at you.
Do you feel OK?

426
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,792
Come here. Are you OK?

427
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:03,959
What should I do?

428
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:43,876
<i>The subscriber cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

429
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:59,626
– Yeah, lots of phones are out of coverage here.
– Excuse me, can I just get...

430
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:07,292
– Where are they talking from?
– At the slope over Geiranger.

431
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:11,834
There are lots in the cottages there.

432
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:16,834
– Can I borrow it?
– Yes.

433
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:19,292
Hello. Hi.

434
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:26,626
I'm wondering... there was a tourist bus
they were going to drive from the hotel...

435
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:31,584
There isn't a bus up with you now?

436
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:39,251
Are you absolutely sure?

437
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:55,001
Thanks.

438
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:19,584
– Hi.
– Where are mum and Sondre?

439
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:30,709
– Dad is going to go and find them now.
– But I don't want you to leave.

440
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:33,584
I understand that.

441
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:38,459
But mum is really worried about us now.

442
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:42,751
She needs to know that we're OK.

443
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:47,334
– Am I going to be left here alone?
– No, you're not going to be alone.

444
01:10:47,501 --> 01:10:50,709
You're going to be with Teresa and Thomas.

445
01:10:52,251 --> 01:10:54,334
You know what I think?

446
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:59,501
Thomas would be very happy if you could
help look after Teresa.

447
01:10:59,667 --> 01:11:04,584
You think you can handle that?

448
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:13,001
You are a brave little girl.
And so nice.

449
01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:18,542
OK. You stay here.

450
01:11:20,501 --> 01:11:23,459
– and I'll find mum.
– And Sondre.

451
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:26,084
And Sondre, of course.

452
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:31,251
OK. I'll do that.

453
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:35,334
OK.

454
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:15,626
I must get out of here.

455
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:18,584
The door, Sondre.

456
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,126
Wait!

457
01:12:20,292 --> 01:12:22,251
Ready. And press!

458
01:12:27,959 --> 01:12:29,751
Come on!

459
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:08,292
I'll get the lamp.
Help me up.

460
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:01,751
Take your jacket off.
Take your jacket off!

461
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,209
– No, screw this!
– Come on!

462
01:14:18,376 --> 01:14:22,626
– There's no point. It's useless.
– Would you rather be out there?

463
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,876
Calm down. We'll wait till the water
has risen above the door.

464
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:30,126
Then the pressure will be lower
and we'll try again.

465
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:35,376
If we wait down here any longer then
we're going to die! Holy shit!

466
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:42,334
We can't wait down here.
We will die.

467
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:21,917
Hello!

468
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:28,001
Hello!

469
01:18:05,209 --> 01:18:07,292
Hello?

470
01:18:55,417 --> 01:19:00,584
Idun? Sondre?

471
01:20:26,334 --> 01:20:28,417
Let's try now.

472
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:22,167
Remove the cover.

473
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:46,834
Phillip, are you OK?

474
01:21:48,501 --> 01:21:51,917
Hold on to the ceiling.
Look, you can hold yourself here.

475
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:58,667
– Take it easy.
– Don't touch me!

476
01:21:58,834 --> 01:22:01,959
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

477
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:07,626
– Calm down. Let him go!
– I'm not going to die here!

478
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:14,376
– Phillip, calm down.
– Let me go, damn it!

479
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:17,834
Phillip, don't panic.

480
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:22,542
– I will not die here!
– It's OK. Calm down.

481
01:22:30,584 --> 01:22:32,584
Phillip!

482
01:22:35,542 --> 01:22:38,792
– Let him go!
– Shut up!

483
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:42,417
Let him go!

484
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:11,501
Don't look.

485
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,709
Hello?

486
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:16,959
Idun! Sondre!

487
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:21,959
Idun!

488
01:24:45,292 --> 01:24:46,876
Sondre!

489
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:25,834
Sondre, I'm terribly sorry.

490
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:33,459
Sondre.

491
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:38,667
Hold on.

492
01:25:40,251 --> 01:25:42,417
Hold tight.

493
01:27:29,292 --> 01:27:31,959
– We are here!
– Hello!

494
01:27:33,126 --> 01:27:35,042
We are here!

495
01:27:48,251 --> 01:27:50,376
Wait here.

496
01:27:55,376 --> 01:27:57,167
Hello!

497
01:28:06,209 --> 01:28:08,126
We are here!

498
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:44,209
Sondre. Wait here.

499
01:30:55,042 --> 01:30:56,917
God!

500
01:31:01,084 --> 01:31:05,084
I am here now.
Everything's going to be all right, Sondre.

501
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:08,917
Are you hurt anywhere?
Can you move?

502
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:14,417
Everything will be OK.

503
01:31:17,959 --> 01:31:24,376
Mum is waiting for us there.
We'll just take one last swim.

504
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:27,417
– No.
– Yes, yes.

505
01:31:27,584 --> 01:31:32,334
Listen now. The water is rising.
Soon there will be no more air.

506
01:31:32,501 --> 01:31:36,334
Then we're both going to die.
And I can't let that happen.

507
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:41,334
Me and mum need you.
And Julia needs you too.

508
01:31:42,334 --> 01:31:45,542
Look at me. We all need you.

509
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:56,667
OK?

510
01:31:58,959 --> 01:32:03,209
I will swim first and you'll
swim right behind me.

511
01:32:04,084 --> 01:32:07,501
I'll keep an eye on you the whole time.
Are you ready?

512
01:32:08,751 --> 01:32:11,042
OK, then let's do it.

513
01:32:14,209 --> 01:32:16,126
One.

514
01:32:16,959 --> 01:32:19,167
Two.

515
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,042
Three.

516
01:33:21,001 --> 01:33:22,501
Sondre!

517
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:46,501
– Where is dad?
– He was right behind me.

518
01:34:31,126 --> 01:34:33,167
Kristian?

519
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:36,209
No. No, what the hell.

520
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:42,834
Dad!

521
01:36:43,917 --> 01:36:45,917
Daddy, please!

522
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,626
Come on!

523
01:36:54,876 --> 01:36:56,917
Dad!

524
01:38:58,042 --> 01:38:59,584
Mum!

525
01:40:23,459 --> 01:40:27,626
The fissures in Åkernes
are monitored continuously today.

526
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:30,876
The cracks grow up to 15cm a year.

527
01:40:31,042 --> 01:40:35,251
All the experts agree that the
landslide is inevitable.

528
01:40:35,417 --> 01:40:39,792
They just don't know when.
